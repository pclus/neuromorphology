# Neuromorphology alterations in Down Syndrome: a computational model of the motor cortex

## Data

Data used in the article can be found in the `data` directory.

The directory contains three files with the Sholl analysis of the 6 reconstructed
neurons for each phenotypes.
First column of each `sholls_<type>.dat` file is the distance from the
soma center (in micrometers), and the next six columns are the number
of intersections for each neuron, obtained from the Sholl analysis.
Refer to the paper Methods section for more details.

The `spines.dat` file contains 4 columns:
	1. Distance from soma in $\mu$m
	2. Spine density per 10$\mu$m corresponding to wild type (WT).
	3. Spine density per 10$\mu$m corresponding to trisomic mice (Ts65Dn).
	4. Spine density per 10$\mu$m corresponding to transgenic mice (TgDyrk1A).
